The arm itself has 2 servos, one for opening and closing the metallic grip, the other for rotating the whole grip. The second servo is installed due to specific mission. Each servo will have 2 respectives button for controlling, one for each direction for the servo to move.  The system also has a safety mechanism that will keep track of the position of the servo so it wouldn't reach the maximum of the degree it can turn and break the servo internally.
